## Project Aim and Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the "Trending Youtube API Dataset" to identify and understand the essential attributes that result in the uploaded video being "trending" on the platform. The project aims to find the patterns in the dataset that would push the videos uploaded by the users into the trending category, thus helping the content creators optimize their video uploads accordingly, contributing to the YouTube algorithm.

The aim of the project is achieved by using data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to find correlations between the different attributes in the dataset. We will use the dataset to recognize the patterns resulting in a trending video. After a thorough analysis of the various aspects, we aim to discern the commonalities among the trending videos while also identifying the factors that may vary across the different genres of YouTube.

In summary, the project aims to provide insight into the dynamics of YouTube trending videos, thereby helping content creators share content that would satisfy the YouTube algorithm and result in the video trending on the platform. The results will help in improving the experience of the users and the YouTube platform.

## Specific Objective(s)
• Objective 1: Visualize the genres that trend in the United Kingdom.

• Objective 2: Checks the key words to be used in the Title and/or Description for a video to be in the trending category.

• Objective 3: Calculates whether the Likes, Dislikes and View Count influences a video to trend.

• Objective 4: Implementing Regression Models to predict View Counts given Attributes.
